# Angel Reese roasted on social media.

Well, while it might have made sense on the surface, people had some savage jokes and responses to the Ravens' video.

Check out some replies below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com:

Do we think Angel Reese is very popular with the social media crowd? It certainly doesn't seem like it. That's what happens when a person embraces the villain roleâ€¦..to only then pin the blame on the media later.

It's amazing how the young WNBA player has managed to build the opposite perception around her from what Caitlin Clark has done. Clark is beloved by fans. Reese seems to have ruined any popularity she had going back to her time at LSU, and is now just getting cooked on a regular basis on social media.
